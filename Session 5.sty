National Drug Policy 
Lecture by Ajarn Netnapis Suchonwanich
Former Deputy Secretary General of NHSO, Thailand 

Objectives and Scope of the Lecture:
    - National Drug Policy, Procurement for supporting Universal Health Care
    - Future challenge to sustain the UHC
    
National Health Policy --> focus on Drug Policy
    - Why political commitment?
    - Pharmaceuticals (vaccines, consumables, diagnostic reagants, drugs, medicine, medical devices and equipment)
        - Pharmaceuticals refers to prevention, diagnosis, and other medical devices 

    - Objectives of NDP: 
        a. Promote the rational use of drugs --> How do we quantify/define rational?
        b. Improve access making them available and affordable
        c. Safety, Efficacy, and Quality 
        Three keywords: Accessibility, Quality Assurance, Rational use

    Expenditures in Pharmaceuticals --> 
        - Philippines 
        - Thailand  - Food and Drugs Administration - Pharmaceuticals expeditures covers public and private -- IMPORTATION 
                    - Utilization 


    Public Sector Procurement
        - Government Procurement Reform Act 
        - Generics Act 
        - Cheaper Medicines Act 

Present Challenges of Global Health 
    - In Philippines: Efficiency in Use of Resource 
        - Recent IBM and WB loan, more tax, increasing health expenditure 

    - According to survey, new technologies will provide higher health expenditures 
Improve the production capacity, supply and demand 

Compare the scenario to support the UHC - if you met all the criteria, you achieved UHC 

National Drug Policy Reform 
    - Thailand: Focusing on research and development
    - Philippines: problems in medicine access: Botika ng Bayan Program 
    - Develop an access for all (all --> necessary medicines) policy 
    - Thailand implemented an information ceter for Intelligent Drug Management 
    - upstream manufacturers 80 \% budget
    - policy incoherence 
    - Thailand is developing the National Drug Policy Strategies for 2023-2027 


Maximum Retail Price (MRP) and Suggested Retail Pricing (SRP) system 
- Electronic Drug Monitoring Price System 

What HTA provided for Thai UCS benefit package development 
    - incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
    - budget impact ompared current practive 
    - Nigeria: Problems with the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, they don't know how much of the GDP should be considered as a threshold 
    - Gross National Income (GNI) per capita

For high-cost medicines, Thailand adopted  a risk sharing system under Managed Entry Agreement. It has a 46\% discount. 
There are only few donors. For instance, bone marrow transplant, it's very rare for people to become donor because discount will not be given to the patient/donor. 
Pay for the donor machines 
If outside the family, spend cost in installments. 

Problems in improvement -- what;s the problem? increase the benefit who can access the program to more and more beenfit --- this is what they caled discriminaition 
Cooverage is ony 10 per cent --> go to other advance benefits --> you are engaging discrimination. how about the remaining 90 per cent? There are sine defects in the 
implementation. ---> DISCRIMINATION of HEALTH PACKAGE 

CSMBS - no scheme price 

In the Philippines 
    - Marketed price after registration approval --> Listed by the Philippne National Drug Formulary and Electronic Drug Monitoring System 
    - Suggested Retail Price and Maximum Retail Price 
    - Scheme Discounted - GSIS/PhilHealth/SSS

UC Fund Reimbursement
    - high-cost drug program 
    - vaccine in EPI program 

Thailand conducts special drug management for tackling the medical acccess problmes in Thailand 
    - For local purchasing, pay the market price and OOP
    - Orphan drugs - antidotes, anti-venom 

Encourage domestic manufacturers to make domestic medicines for venoms and poison - 3USD 
Minimum order?? Every year, DOH should check the expiry of the antidote 
    - Reorder for stock or not? 
            - Negotiation - mutual benefits among other countries, make a deal 

Designing the precision medicine in UC and SSS schemes 

Final goal is self-care - not use too much of the medicine 
Most of the drug stores -- In Philippines, all pharmacy stores requires to employ pharmacist to employ patient self-care and give the appropriate medicine to the 
patients and consumers. 

Horizontal scanning - you have to look for the market if there are new products that are similar to the one you are working now whether you solve the gap that exists
in medical care. Before you conduct evaluation, you need to determine if horizontal scanning exists. Then you reassess, or amend, if needed. 

Some products have a lot of uncertainty, you need to correct if it is proper for the government ot invest on this health care system  
Cost-benefit analysis - all of this should be mentioned in Health Technoology Assessment. 

Need to formulate a policy for medicines with uncertain outcomes. --> Why not use uncertainty quantification
They use a new protocol with some indication and correct the data from the hospital in order to prove the result. Conduct the economic evaluation.

If medicines are declared as prohinited but very useful:
    - it may not be applied to the hospital 
    - if publicly approved, it may disrupt the image of a specific company
