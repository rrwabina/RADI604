Session 4: Systems Thinking and the core function of Health Systems

PRINCIPLES ABD CONCEPTS OF SYSTEMS THINKING
What is a system?
    - a collection of things that are working together to achieve a specific system 
    - body systems (circulatory system), government systems
    - Food Systems 
        - Components of Health Systems and its Relationships
        - Economic reforms lease lands for the government- Sustainable food systemm (BAC farming)
        - Waste --> Recycle --> Reuse to other systems
        - Fish, main business 
        - Fish gardening + Livestock + Poultry
            --> Biogas from pigs' system --> Powers cooking and other production system
            --> Biogas also helps the environment and crop irrigation 
            --> All the food they are are produced in the farm 
            --> Good nutrition 
            --> Land is very limited so they need to improvise methods to produce a sustainable farming system 
        - Policymaking, Nutrition and Education --> vital for sustainable food system
    What can we learn?
        - Food security 
    - interrelationship of subsystems to create a whole system - working together to create different Relationships
    - Subsystems have their own objectives - very simple and limited objectives 
    - Health as a system
        - Food in health, environment
    - What makes it unique is that it is sustainable among the people, especially due to the good policymaking 

Systems and Complexity 
    - Complicated   
        - many components         
        - systems vary by their type i.e., airplane system - with 2.3 million subcomponents that are controllable and predictable
          to minimize human error 
    - Complex Systems
        - Elements and Relations 
        - Organization is form through interactions of parts 
        - New patterns are developed - people from various social groups - have hierarchial system
        - Multi-dimensionality 
        - We cannot fuly isolate one compoent or reduce the whole thing to one level
            - Without central control
        - Nonlinearity - may be unpredictable due to interdependent nature
            - Phase transition - small change in input value trigger a large systemic effect 
        - Connectivity - dense systems, how things flow in the network???
            - Network structure and degree of connectivity 
        - Adaptation
            - Rule-based coordination 
                - Emergence of patterns 
            - Competition based - Evolutioanry track 

    Health Systems 
        - Food system + Nutrition
        - Health Education/ Health Literacy 
        - Environment/Water Sanitation 
        - Primary intent is to promote, restore, or maintain health 
        - Health System --> Healthcare --> Medical Care 
        - Adaptive to changes to various elements 
        - COVID: a complex adaptive system - there are several elements that are vital to mitigate the disease 
        - Casual-loops!!! --> dynamical system modeling 
        - Security, Trade and Economics, Social and Health

Health systems Frameworks and the HS Building Blocks Concept 
    - In the past, people tend to classify the health system into three groups
        - Beveridge (UK) - public healthcare, universal access
        - Bismark (Germany) - Private Health financing 
        - National Health Insurance - public financing, private delivery (combination of Beveridge and Bismark) 
        - Out-of-Pockets - Private financing

    - The WHO 2000 framework was changed into six building blocks - more linear and easy to understand 
    - However, WHO 2007/8 does not show its relationshop among the components. Therefore, it cannot predict 
    - Other frameworks include AHPSR;s Health System Framework
        - Not very popular and the goals are similar with WHO 2007/8

Social Determinants of Health 
    - Key factors that influences the population health, indiviudual and lifestyle factors 

Health System Performance 
    - Access 
    - Equity 
    - Quality
    - Efficiency 

Application of Systems Thinking in Health Systems 

    - Start within the community and address the community as a single element and work with different stakeholder 
    - Adjsut the change and improve the healthcare access 
    - Understand keyholders' value, map the adjustments that are vital 
'Triangles that moves the mountain'
    - To create a good change, you need to move the three sectors
        a. Knowledge - work with intellectuals 
        b. social movement - civil society
        c. political involvement - politicians, government
    - If you only work to one sector, it may likely not 'move' or does not result to any change 
    - Structural change (remember Singapore example)
    - Address the changes in power dynamics (i.e., who has the power and how do they respond?)
    - Mental Models - Transfomative Change. All people should struggle to create a big change (i.e., universal health care). This model is the most difficult part.
