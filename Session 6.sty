Health Promotion and Health in All Policies 

What is health promotion?  
    - Health is the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization)
    - Ottawa Charter started in Canada, gathering all data
        - While Canada has excellent health system, there are several problems on their mortality (i.e., heart attack, accidents)

    Health Promotion 
        - Analyzed the cause of disease --> what prevention?
        - Prevention vs Promotion? 
        - Without any preventions or health promotions, people will die easily to a particular disease since no interventions were initiated to stop the disease transmission
        - Imposing several policies --> cut down plane flight, cut down all the international flights, stop school and work from home 
        - People will die a lot if no interventions imposed. For instance, COVID-19 pandemic. 
        - Face mask --> can help to mitigate the virus transmission 
    Nigeria: i.e., postulate: genetic-based immunity 

Is health promotion also risks the people's privacy? 
    - Governments impose restrictions such as COVID19 monitoring and tracking. Is it still an issue if life's on the line?
