Health Promotion and Health in All Policies 

What is health promotion?  
    - Health is the absence of disease or infirmity (World Health Organization)
    - Ottawa Charter started in Canada, gathering all data
        - While Canada has excellent health system, there are several problems on their mortality (i.e., heart attack, accidents)

    Health Promotion 
        - Analyzed the cause of disease --> what prevention?
        - Prevention vs Promotion? 
        - Without any preventions or health promotions, people will die easily to a particular disease since no interventions were initiated to stop the disease transmission
        - Imposing several policies --> cut down plane flight, cut down all the international flights, stop school and work from home 
        - People will die a lot if no interventions imposed. For instance, COVID-19 pandemic. 
        - Face mask --> can help to mitigate the virus transmission 
    Nigeria: i.e., postulate: genetic-based immunity 

Is health promotion also risks the people's privacy? 
    - Governments impose restrictions such as COVID19 monitoring and tracking. Is it still an issue if life's on the line? 
    - Exercise, Nutrition, Food, Education, Immnunization, Avoid drugs, smoking, and excessive drinking 
    - Health policy is a solution. It is a course of action to solve a particular problem. For instance, to mitigate the COVID-19 transmission, governments impose 
      a mandatory rule for people to wear face masks outside their houses. 
        - How do we know that a health policy is successful?

Create Supportive Environment 
    - Lack of good quality urban designs, exert energy 
        - Health promotion in a supportive environment (i.e., good public transportation)
            - You can start with political will!!!!!!!
    
Strengthening Community Action 
    - Strengthening public participation for health promotion (i.e., consultation drives, transparency systems) 
    - Full and continuous access to information
    - Funding support 
    - i.e., COVID19 situation --> wearing masks 

Reorient Health Services
    - open channels between the health sector and broader social, political, economic, and physical environmental components 

Health in All Policies (HiAP)
    - In Thailand, to lessen the respiratory disease cases, they provide subsidy to people if people will buy non-combustible (electric) cars
    - However, these policies are rare since most countries choose economy over health. 
    - It improves the accountability of policymakers for health impacts at all levels of policy-making. It includes an emphasis on the consquences of public policiees
      on health systems, determinants of health and well-being.

Non-communicable diseases 

Government and Corporations
    - Once government impose policies, i.e., salt intake reduction, salt production companies may not agree to this policy due to profit reduction. 
    - Cooperate with the government

Policymakes should focus on enabling people to control over to their health.
