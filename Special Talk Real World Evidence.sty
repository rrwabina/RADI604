Real world evidence in HTA: Where are we now?

Precision medicine  - the use of genomics, the desire to use the real-world data
                    - targeted method, patient-specific methodologies --> this may produce uncertainties

Current use of real world data
    - incidence and long-term outcomes (epidemiology)
    - develop or validate digital health technologies and may use a clinical algorithm developed using real-world data

Electronic Patient Record Forms - transferred to an automatic algorithm to identify alcohol-related callouts using free-texts in EPRFs
Evolving evidence needs in areas such as rare disease and adaptive licenese demands earlier licensing - hence use of a more uncertain evidence base

Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in real-world evidence
    - it is possible that the clinical uncertainty can be addressed through the ccolection of outcome data from patients treated in the NHS 
    - other concerns revolve in the mismathc of patient population, small sample size ---> uncertainties 

The studie employed broad eligibility criteria to recruit large, heterogeneous populations 
The real-world data may not be replicated and only is generalizable.
    - Next steps:   
        - consensus on terminology, i.e., real-world data and real-world evidence 
        - acceptability of RWE
        - hierarchies of evidences
