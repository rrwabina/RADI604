Health Information System and Big Data in Healthcare
Email: panu.loo@ceb-rama.org 

Source of data/information:
    1. Collect the data from different medium
    2. Revolution of data acquisition i.e., paper to electronic records

Structured data     --> tabular data
Unstructured data   --> image, signals, JSON files

Leverage the data into different forms
    - For instance, Thailand created a data dashboard that displays a real-time monitoring system of COVID19 cases
    - Electronic data are durable and long-lasting compared to paper-based data medium

Precision medicine is in the high-rise topics in AI and Healthcare 
Text-to-image models 

Effective coverage of DM/HT --> hospital information system, using NEMO database center
    - Covering 255 Hospitals
    - Which hospital provides better healthcare services/low cost? 

Deep Learning for Discrimination Between Fungal Keratitis and Batecial Keratisis 
    - base models: VGG16 and DenseNet-121
     
Big Data in Healthcare and Medical Records 
    - Health Data in Thailand   
        - 43-Files: Every hospital is required to acquire the patient's data to monitor their health status

Due to massive changes in data acquisition, there are also changes in study DESING
    - Researchers are required to provide a signatory form to inform respondents in data usage

Database Management System
    - 10 years of real-world longitudinal data with monthly update 
    - It compromises data warehouse systems 
    - Used SQL for data management, Python for data analysis 

Three essential skills of data scientist:
    1. Computer Science --> programming skills 
    2. Maths and Statistics --> Derivative (neural networks), Statistics (exploratory data analysis)
    3. Subject Matter Expertise --> domain problems 

Statistics vs Data Science 

Data Engineer:
    - Acquisition/Recording
    - Extraction/Cleaning/Annotaiton
    - Integration/Aggregation/Representation
    - Works with Data Scientist to determine which data to use 
        - It is vital that both DS and DE work together
Data Scientist:
    - Analysis/Modeling 
Data Analysis:
    - Interpretation
        - Descriptive modeling 

Prescriptive Analytics --> how can we make it happen? 
    - Optimization
    - Decision Modeling 

Big Data Analytics in Healthcare 
    - knowledge discovery 
    - modeling of biological structures

Data Lake > Data Warehouse > Data Mart 

Research 
    - Enough knowledge
    - Encryption problems  
    - integration of data to other problems, they are required to remove some parts
    - Delayed research --> delay of the research because of the insufficient knowledge
        - Data breaches of patient's data in the hospital's databases 

Data Management encodes and decodes the patients' status and information 
    - They have decoding algorithms
    - They send the data to the specialist 
    - Each data have their own decryption system
    - Hash the patients' information 
    - Encryption problems 
    - Encrypt: Hash the patient ID, manipulate the date and other relevant information
        - Date transformed into years - downside: server analysis is impossible, even time-series analysis
